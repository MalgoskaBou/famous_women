<h2>The project moved forward :)</h2>

Updated **14.02.2018**

The application takes shape and looks better and better. We would love to let more people know about our work. We are developing very fast and we are programming better and better üí™

New update of our application üòÑ :

**@Oya Canli** - added search options in the list, and she's still working on improving the code. The code is becoming more and more modern and it's really much easier to work with it now.

**@Greta Gr** - has implemented a beautiful collapsing toolbar animation in the detail screen - now it looks really cool and dynamic. She also came up with a great idea of using vector icons flag - so we have fewer images to add.

**JuliaR** - refactorized the code, now everything is very clear, and thanks to **@Alexandra**'s great idea we have now added a voice search function. Keep going ;)

**@Ami** - add an option to sort the list - now regardless of the order in the table - our entries are displayed in alphabetical order.

**@SvCat** - designed and added a screen about the application üòÑ the last missing part in our work. After the **Greta's** amendments, looks wonderful

Updated **08.01.2018**

**@Ami** and **@Oya Canli** solved the problem with the quiz - after the screen rotation the questions were not visible  - they used very interesting solutions (Parcelable interface and HashMap) - now everything works perfectly üòÑ

**@Jula**, **@Saida** and **@kafr007** worked on a list of famous women lately - they added their entries and questions to the lists and improved other descriptions.

Joined us also **@Kami**, today she got acquainted with the project and just starts playing with the code! üòä

Everyone is constantly tracking the code and correcting mistakes.

<h3> üëç Thanks to all of you, the app is growing - great cooperation! üëç </h3>

Updated **08.01.2018**

- Thanks to the work of **@Diana** and **@Slimsonik**, we have already developed a menu. In the menu you can choose a quiz and a page with information about the application. Both options are not finished yet so I invite you to cooperate :)

**let's begin!**

<h2>Hello all</h2>

I have changed a MIWOK application for you - from the UDACITY course *(Android Basic: Multiscreen App)* - for to apply it to create the application about famous women that we want to do. Based on this code, we can write our own.

I would like each of us to get acquainted with this before starting work. Thanks to this, it will be easier to imagine what work awaits us :).
Don't be afraid to ask, if you don't understand some part of it. 

Just right now is the time to explain this whole mess ;).

Our first task, will be to search for information about all functions, that we should use to create our application. 
The sample code will be of help - I would like us to write an explanation of each part of this application, so that everyone can understand it. Something like instruction or scientific help.

List of works and functions to be explained, I will elaborate (I am counting that @Ola help me here), and I share ready version as I promised next week. Now I would like everyone to get used to the code and next week we will explain everything that is not understandable in our work, thanks to the tasks what we share among ourselves. If anyone would like to help with the preparation of the list too, or have other questions or suggestions or maybe problems, please let me know and write about it on the channel. we should help each other :) .

If someone has a problem with using Github, I recommend this link -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci3W1T88mzw&index=53&list=PLIX5kQLXWHaHnsgkOWxgo2TTJfeNXVC0e <- the movie lasts only few minutes and makes life easier.
 

**Greetings from cold Poland**  
**@MalgoskaG**

*This is what the final application should look like:*

*Additionally, @Ola proposal to add a menu from which you can choose a quiz*
