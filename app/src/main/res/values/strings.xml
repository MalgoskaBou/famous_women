    <string name="body_details_description_dalia">Dalia Grybauskaitė (born in Vilnius on 1 March 1956), referred to as the \"Iron Lady\" or the
        \"Steel Magnolia\", is the President of Lithuania, inaugurated on 12 July 2009 and re-elected in May 2014. \nShe is the country\'s first
        female President and the first President of Lithuania to be reelected for a second consecutive term. \nIn her declaration speech for the 2009
        presidential election, Dalia Grybauskaitė said: \"I decided to return to Lithuania if the Lithuanian people decide I am needed there now.
        I think that we all long for the truth, transparency and responsibility for our country. We all want to live without fear, with confidence
        in ourselves, in each other, and in tomorrow. I can and I want to contribute with my experience, knowledge and skills to expel shadows from
        morality, politics, and economics to create a citizen-ruled Lithuania – a state of citizens. Therefore, I will run for the Lithuanian presidency.
        \" The international press was quick to dub her the \"Lithuanian Iron Lady\" for her outspoken speech and her black belt in karate.
        Dalia Grybauskaitė, who speaks Lithuanian, English, Russian, French and Polish, has mentioned Margaret Thatcher and Mahatma Gandhi as her
        political role models. \nShe was Vice-Minister of Finance (from 1999 to 2000), Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs (from 2000-2001) and Minister
        of Finance (from 2001 to 2004). Lithuania joined the European Union on 1 May 2004, and Dalia Grybauskaitė was named a European Commissioner
        on the same day. She initially served as European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth. She held this position
        until 11 November 2004, when she was named European Commissioner for Financial Programming and the Budget within the José Manuel Barroso-led
        Commission. In November 2005, she was elected Commissioner of the Year for her efforts to reform the EU budget. Dalia Grybauskaitė never had
        dreamt of becoming president, but rather pursued her career to the highest possible level, working hard at every opportunity.
        Her determination led her to run for presidency and seemed at the time to be the natural progression of her career. \nOn May 9, 2013
        President Dalia Grybauskaitė was presented the prestigious International Charlemagne Prize. The award, also known as \"Oscar in Politics\",
        has been extended to President Grybauskaitė for Lithuania\'s contribution to uniting the European Union and building the economic stability
        of the whole Europe. \"I dedicate the Charlemagne Prize, awarded by the people of Aachen, to the Lithuanian people. It signifies the
        recognition of our united efforts as we fought for Lithuania\'s freedom and its place in Europe as well as to overcome the economic crisis.
        This award is also a commitment to assume responsibility for bringing all the nations together to shape the future of Europe,\" the President
        emphasized at the award ceremony. \nDalia Grybauskaitė takes 68 place in Frobes The World\'s 100 Most Powerful Women list (2017 ranking).
        \nToday, Dalia is a modern leader and maintains a strong connection with the Lithuanian people through social media interaction,
        sharing her news, schedule and ideas.</string>

    <string name="body_details_description_elisabeta">Elisabeta Rizea (28 June 1912 – 6 October 2003) was a Romanian anti-communist partisan in the
        Făgăraş Mountains of Northern Wallachia. After the Romanian Revolution, she became the symbol of Romania\'s anti-communism resistance.
        Rizea was born in Nucșoara, a small village in Argeş County in the Southern Carpathians, to a family of peasants who lived off plot of
        cultivated land. After World War II, as the Soviet Army imposed a Communist government in Romania, the peasants had to give up their
        land in order to implement collective farming. Out of opposition to this, Elisabeta Rizea and her husband joined an anti-Communist guerrilla
        group, Haiducii Muscelului, led by Colonel Gheorghe Arsenescu. Her assigned task within the group was to provide food and supplies.
        After she was captured by the Romanian militia in 1952, she was declared \"duşman al poporului\" (enemy of the people) and sentenced to
        death because she refused to give information about the other partisans. Eventually her sentence was commuted to seven years in prison.
        When Arsenescu was arrested in 1961, her sentence was extended by another 25 years, but three years later, in 1964, she was freed under
        the terms of a general amnesty.
        During her twelve years spent in prison, she was subjected to various forms of torture: she was hung by her hair from a hook and beaten
        until she fainted due to broken ribs, and was also scalped, burned, and beaten with a shovel. Upon her release from prison, she had no hair
        and she couldn\'t walk, as her knees had been destroyed by the torture.</string>

    <string name="body_details_description_mother_theresa">Mother Teresa (1910–1997) was a Roman Catholic nun who devoted her life to serving
    the poor and destitute around the world. Mother Teresa was born in 1910 in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia.
    Little is known about her early life, but at a young age, she felt a calling to be a nun and serve through helping the poor.
    At the age of 18, she was given permission to join a group of nuns in Ireland. After a few months of training, with the Sisters of Loreto,
    she was then given permission to travel to India. She took her formal religious vows in 1931 and chose to be named after St Therese of Lisieux –
    the patron saint of missionaries.On her arrival in India, she began by working as a teacher; however, the widespread poverty of Calcutta
    made a deep impression on her, and this led to her starting a new order called “The Missionaries of Charity”. The primary objective
    of this mission was to look after people, who nobody else was prepared to look after.
    In 1948, she left the convent to live full-time among the poorest of Calcutta. She chose to wear a white Indian sari,
    with a blue border, out of respect for the traditional Indian dress. For many years, Mother Teresa and a small band of fellow nuns
    survived on minimal income and food, often having to beg for funds. But, slowly her efforts with the poorest were noted and appreciated
    by the local community and Indian politicians. In 1952, she opened her first home for the dying, which allowed people to die with dignity.
    The Missionaries of Charity now has branches throughout the world including branches in the developed world where they work with the homeless
    and people affected by AIDS. In 1965, the organisation became an International Religious Family by a decree of Pope Paul VI.
    In the 1960s, the life of Mother Teresa was brought to a wider public attention by Malcolm Muggeridge who wrote a book
    and produced a documentary called “Something Beautiful for God”.In 1979, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize “for work undertaken
    in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace.” She didn’t attend the ceremonial banquet
    but asked that the $192,000 fund be given to the poor. Over the last two decades of her life, Mother Teresa suffered various health problems,
    but nothing could dissuade her from fulfilling her mission of serving the poor and needy. Until her very last illness she was active
    in travelling around the world to the different branches of The Missionaries of Charity.
    Following Mother Teresa’s death, the Vatican began the process of beatification, which is the second step on the way to canonization and sainthood.
    Mother Teresa was formally beatified in October 2003 by Pope John Paul II.</string>

        \nTelkes is known for creating the first thermoelectric power generator in 1947, designing the first solar heating system for the Dover Sun House in Dover, Massachusetts, (built entirely with solar heating, with the architect Eleanor Raymond and the first thermoelectric refrigerator in 1953 using the principles of semiconductor thermoelectricity.
        \nShe was a prolific inventor of practical thermal devices, including a miniature desalination unit for use on lifeboats, which used solar power and condensation to collect potable solar still. The still saved the lives of airmen and sailors who would have been without water when abandoned at sea.
        \nOne of her specialties were phase-change materials, including molten salts to store thermal energy. One of her materials of choice was Glauber\'s salt.elkes is considered one of the founders of solar thermal storage systems, earning her the nickname "the Sun Queen".

    <string name="body_details_description_sirleaf"> Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is the world\'s first elected black female president and Africa\'s first elected female head of state.
        Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was born on October 29, 1938, in Monrovia, Liberia. A graduate of the College of West Africa at Monrovia, she went on to receive her bachelor\'s degree in accounting from the Madison Business College in Madison, Wisconsin, a degree in economics from the University of Colorado at Boulder and a Master of Public Administration degree from Harvard University.
        After returning to Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf served as assistant minister of Finance in President William Tolbert\'s administration. In 1980, Tolbert was overthrown and killed by army sergeant Samuel Doe, who represented the Krahn ethnic group. Johnson Sirleaf went into exile in Nairobi, Kenya, as well as in the United States, where she worked as an executive in the international banking community.
        In 1985, Johnson Sirleaf returned to Liberia and ran for a seat in the Senate, but when she spoke out against Doe\'s military regime, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison. She served a partial sentence before moving to Washington, D.C. When she returned to her native country for a third time in 1997, it was as an economist, working for the World Bank and Citibank in Africa.
        After supporting Charles Taylor\'s bloody rebellion against President Samuel Doe in 1990, Johnson Sirleaf ran unsuccessfully against Taylor in the 1997 presidential election. Taylor subsequently charged Johnson Sirleaf with treason. In 2005, after campaigning for the removal of President Taylor, Johnson Sirleaf took over as leader of the Unity Party.
        That year, promising economic development and an end to corruption and civil war, she was elected to the Liberian presidency. When she was inaugurated in 2006, Johnson Sirleaf, or the \"Iron Lady\", as she was also known, became the world\'s first elected black female president and Africa\'s first elected female head of state.
        Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has four sons and six grandchildren, some of whom live in Atlanta, Georgia. </string>


  
    <string name="body_details_description_meriem"> In March 2005, astronomer and explorer Merieme Chadid became the first Moroccan woman to set
        foot on Antarctica, where she planted the flag of Morocco – the first Arab flag to be placed in this remote location. Listed by Forbes
        Magazine as one of the thirty most interesting workers in the world,
        Chedid was one of the astronomers involved in installing VLT telescopes in Chile\'s barren Atacama Desert, and is considered to be the
        world\'s first astronomer to be committed to installing the large astronomical observatory in Antarctica, where she has carried out
        pioneering work at Dome C of the Concordia Research Station.
        Born in Casablanca on 11 October 1969, Merieme Chadid became interested in astronomy from a young age. A book about 17th century German
        astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler further inspired her, as did a radio broadcast by fellow Moroccan and astronomy enthusiast
        Albert Pilot. She contacted Pilot regarding her interest
        in the field and he encouraged her to pursue her passion for astronomy, which she continues to do.
        After earning an MA in physics at the University of Casablanca, Chadid moved to Nice where she studied imaging science, before continuing
        her education at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, obtaining a PhD for her study entitled Stellar Pulsation and Evolution. Her career
        continued as an engineer astrophysicist at
        the National Center for Scientific Research located in Montpellier, France. It was while working in this capacity that Merieme Chadid was
        selected by the European Southern Observatory to work on the installation of the VLT – Very Large Telescope – in the Atacama Desert.
        Of all her many achievements, Merieme notes that one of her most treasured accomplishments has been her work at Dome C in Antarctica,
        describing it as one of the coldest, most deserted and inaccessible places in the world, and comparing the installation of an observatory
        there as resembling a space mission.
        With night continuing for several months of the year, researchers at the station have the advantage of being able to study the stars 24/7
        if they need to. Certainly, this Moroccan astronomer has come a long way since she first studied the night skies in the country of her
        birth. </string>

    <string name="body_details_description_irena">Irena Sendler was a 29-year-old social worker, employed by the Warsaw Welfare Department, when
        World War II broke out. She took advantage of her job in order to help the Jews, by offering them food and shelter.
    \nIn November 1940, when the Warsaw Ghetto was sealed off, it became practically impossible to help isolated Jews. The Ghetto was a small area
    with 400,000 Jewish people forced into it. The poor hygienic conditions in the crowded ghetto, the lack of food and medical supplies resulted
    in epidemics and high death rates. Sendler managed to obtain a permit from the municipality that enabled her to enter the ghetto to inspect
    the sanitary conditions. Assisted by a group of co-workers, she devised means to help the Jews.
    \nThis work was done at huge risk, as giving any kind of assistance to Jews in German-occupied Poland was punishable by death.
    \nWith the help of Council for Aid to Jews (Żegota), Sendler smuggled approximately 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto and then
    provided them with false identity documents and helped set up hiding places for them (Polish Christian families or orphanages). Irena and
    others who went with her into the ghetto, used different methods to smuggle children out: in ambulances and trams (hiding them in packages
    and suitcases), by secret underground passages, and many other ways.
    \nSendler was determined to prevent the children from losing their Jewish identities, she made sure that each person hiding a child realised
    the child must be returned to Jewish relatives after the war, she also kept careful documentation listing the children\'s fake Christian names,
    their given names, and their current location.
    \nThe German occupiers eventually discovered her activities, and she was arrested in 1943. She was tortured during the questioning - she had
    her legs and feet fractured. Despite this, she refused to betray any of her comrades or the children they rescued, and was sentenced to death.
    Żegota saved her life by bribing the guards on the way to her execution. After her escape, she hid from the Germans, but returned to Warsaw
    under a fake name and continued her involvement with the Żegota until the end of the war.
    \nAfter the war, she and her co-workers gathered all of the children\'s records with the names and locations of the hidden Jewish children and
    gave them to their Żegota colleague and his staff at the Central Committee of Polish Jews.
    \nAlmost all of the children\'s parents had been killed at the Treblinka extermination camp or had gone missing.
    \n\nIn 1965, Sendler was recognised by Yad Vashem as one of the Righteous among the Nations. Late in life, she was awarded the Order of the
    White Eagle, Poland\'s highest honour, for her wartime humanitarian efforts. She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Price twice.
    \nWith the exception of diplomats who issued visas to help Jews flee Nazi-occupied Europe, Sendler saved more Jews than any other individual
    during the Holocaust.</string>

        Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova was born in the Yaroslavl Region of Russia on March 6, 1937. She was the second born of three children.
        Her father was a tractor driver and her mother worked in a textile plant. Valentina began school in 1945 at the age of eight.
        In 1953, she left school and began working. She continued her education by correspondence courses.
        \nValentina became interested in parachute jumping at an early age. It was her expertise in parachute jumping that led to her selection as a cosmonaut.
        Tereshkova was a textile-factory assembly worker and an amateur parachutist when she was recruited into the cosmonaut program.
        Under the direction of Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, four women were selected to be trained for a special woman-in-space program.
        Of the four women selected, only Valentina Tereshkova completed a space mission.
        \nTereshkova was launched aboard Vostok 6 on June 16, 1963 and became the first woman to fly in space.
        During the 70.8 hour flight, Vostok 6 made 48 orbits of Earth.
        Upon completion of her mission, Tereshkova was honored with the title Hero of the Soviet Union.
        She never flew again, but she did become a spokesperson for the Soviet Union.
        While fulfilling this role, she received the United Nations Gold Medal of Peace.
        \nOn November 3, 1963, Tereshkova married astronaut Andrian Nikolayev.
        Their first child, a daughter named Elena, was a subject of medical interest because she was the first child born to parents who had both been exposed to space.
        Elena later went on to become a medical doctor. Tereshkova and Nikolayev divorced in 1980.

    <string name="body_details_descriprion_prof_dora"> Professor Dora Nkem Akunyili (14 July 1954 – 7 June 2014) was the Director General of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC)
        \nof Nigeria and Nigerian Minister of Information and Communications from 2008 to 2010. She was a pharmacist and governmental administrator who gained international recognition and won several
        \nawards for her work in pharmacology, public health and human rights. Following her appointment as the Director General of NAFDAC in April 2001, Akunyili established as a top priority the
        \neradication of counterfeit drugs and unsafe food. Before her assumption of office in NAFDAC, fake and substandard foods and drugs were sold in Nigeria without any form of regulation.
        \nShe was disheartened that so many of her countrymen and women were fighting killer diseases like malaria and tuberculosis with little more than sugar syrup and chalk tablets,
        \ncynically packaged to look like the real drugs." Although Akunyili faced considerable risk to her personal safety in her fight to combat the issue of fake drugs, she was persistent and things turned around for the better.
